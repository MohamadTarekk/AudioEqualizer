# AudioEqualizer

This Project was developed for **Digital Signals Proessing** course at _"Faculty of Engineering, Alexandria University"_.

The application uses _Digital Filters_ to analyse an input audio file into 10 frequency bands
 - 0 Hz to 170 Hz
 - 170 Hz to 310 Hz
 - 310 Hz to 600 Hz
 - 600 Hz to 1k Hz
 - 1k Hz to 3k Hz
 - 3k Hz to 6k Hz
 - 6k Hz to 12k Hz
 - 12k Hz to 14k Hz
 - 14k Hz to 16k Hz
 - 16k Hz and above

The user can specify a gain for each frequency band to manipulae the input audio and test the results.

The are 2 options for the filteration technique:
 - Infinite inpulse response **IIR** filters
 - Finite impulse response **FIR** filters

The user can also examine the results by compairing several plots for input and output.

The user can, as well, check plots for each filter specifying its properties and results.
